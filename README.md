# Coustomer-Churn-project
• Analyzed customer data to pinpoint churn triggers using Python and its associated libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn
• Executed data preprocessing tasks: de-duplication, handling of missing values, and outlier management
• Explored data deeply to recognize correlations between churn & variables like demographics, usage, and satisfaction metrics
• Deployed ML models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict churn probabilities
• Utilized tools like Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub for efficient teamwork and version management
